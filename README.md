Description

Tactical turn-based multiplayer game that would look like how the combat plays out in the Civilization games.
One player will control a team of heroes and the other player will control a number of monsters that the first player must defeat. The players move their characters on a grid, and each character have a number of actions available per turn, such as a move action or an attack action. Initially, players decide where to put their characters on the grid, according to some constrains.

The web server runs the game logic and the web clients would display the graphics and receive input from the players and send those inputs to the server. The backend store would store the different characters that are available to the players and the player accounts.

Uses Node.js, connect, Express, and Socket.IO.
