- Save the game state

The current version does not save the game state, so if one player lost his connection, he won't be able to continue the game.
To implement this feature, we could save all game information on the database. So, the game could work as real-time application and, also, for players
that does not have enough time to play a entire game.

- Add Social Network features

Add Friends to your profile, create a leaderboard between your friends. It could be implement by adding more information to the database and change a few things in how the profile are show.
