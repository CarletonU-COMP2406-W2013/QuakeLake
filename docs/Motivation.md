Motivation

The goal of this project was to develop a multiplayer game hosted on a simple, hassle-free website.

The game is a fast-paced, turn-based tactical deathmatch for two players. We wanted to create a game that offered a bit more variety than two similar teams bashing on each other, so we implemented a few features that are not commonly found in tactical grid-based games. One of them is the assymmetry offered by the choice of characters: each player has a restricted number of characters that are unavailable to the other player. This motivates the players to develop different approaches, as the abilities and costs of characters are different. Another feature is the possibility to flank opponents, emphasizing the importance of the position of the characters.
