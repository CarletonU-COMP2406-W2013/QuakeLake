Motivation

The goal of this project was to develop a multiplayer game hosted on a simple, hassle-free website.

The game is a fast-paced, turn-based tactical deathmatch for two players. We wanted to create a game that offered a bit more variety than two similar teams bashing on each other, so we implemented a few features that are not commonly found in tactical grid-based games. One of them is the assymmetry offered by the choice of characters: each player has a restricted number of characters that are unavailable to the other player. This motivates the players to develop different approaches, as the abilities and costs of characters are different. Another feature is the possibility to flank opponents, emphasizing the importance of the position of the characters.

One objective was to also provide a platform that didn't bother the users, so we offer them a way to play anonymously or logged in, with the latter one offering the advantage of keeping a record of your victories.

While the project was also conceived as an interesting way to learn the ropes of web development, we wanted to produce a web application that we could easily extend, since making a fun game is much harder than making "just" a game. Therefore, adding features is simple enough given the current architecture of the game, whether it's different objectives, new characters, or a variety of maps.
